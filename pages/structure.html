                OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <p>
                OBJECTIVEThe aim of the QA Division Team Structure’s new composition proposal is <strong>to create a
                    sustainable process that promotes scalability.</strong></p>
            <p class="p-indent">Each of the Swappable Projects will be grouped together to form one autonomous set. All
                of these <strong>Autonomous Set</strong> of Swappable Projects needs to:</p>

            <ul class="ul-count">
                <li>Ensure that every Project has one SME QA and one Back-up QA.</li>
                <li>Implement one Azure (Kanban) board to monitor the process within the respective Swappable Project
                    autonomous set.</li>
                <li>Make sure that QAs that belong to a specific autonomous project set are knowledgeable about the:
                    <br> a. Application under test
                    <br>b. Internal Standard Operating Protocols being implemented (within the Project)

                </li>

                <li>Conduct Knowledge Transfer sessions within the project sets whenever possible and whenever
                    necessary.
                    <br>a. Short-term goal: QA assignment rotation inside Swappable Project Autonomous Sets
                    <br>b. Long-term goal: QA assignment rotation outside Swappable Project Autonomous Sets

            <h2>PROPOSED NEW TEAM STRUCTURE</h2>
            <h3>I. Definition of Terms</h3>
            <p><strong>Autonomous Set:</strong> Refers to different Projects grouped together. It implies that the
                particular Set of Projects are independent from each other, thus the use of the word “Autonomous”. </p>
            <p><strong>SME QA: </strong>Subject Matter Expert QA or the Main QA in an Autonomous Set. Sometimes could be
                the Lead of the Autonomous Set</p>
            <p><strong>Back-up QA: </strong>QA who will serve as a Point of Contact in the absence of the SME QA or the
                Main QA. It is necessary to make sure that the Back-up QA is equipped with the knowledge and skills that
                the SME/Main QA does have.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>II. Groupings of Project per “Autonomous Set”</h3>
            <p>
                1. Given the following Accountability Chart structure,</p>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img class="img--flow" src="../data/images/structure/s2.png">

        <section>
            <h3> </h3>
            <p>
                2. Each of the above Projects will be grouped together into autonomous sets:</p>
            <div class="img-container">

            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>3. Each of the Autonomous Set of Projects will have the following composition:</p>
            <h3>
                a. Autonomous Set 1 </h3>
            i. QA1 of P1 will be the SME QA of P1, while QA2 will be the Back-up QA of P1<br>
            ii. QA2 of P2 will be the SME QA of P2, while QA1 will be the Back-up QA of P1<br>
            iii. QA3 of P3 will be the SME QA of P3, while QA5 will be the Back-up QA of P3<br>
            iv. QA5 of P5 will be the SME QA of P5, while QA3 will be the Back-up QA of P5<br>

            <h3>
                b. Autonomous Set 2 </h3>
            i. QA4 of P4 will be the SME QA of P4, while QA7 will be the Back-up QA of P4<br>
            ii. QA7 of P7 will be the SME QA of P7, while QA4 will be the Back-up QA of P7<br>
            iii. QA6 of P6 will be the SME QA of P6, while QA4 will be the Back-up QA of P6<br>


        </section>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> For future expansion of Swappable Project group, two things can be an action item,
                each newly-added QA and/or Project will be:</p>
            iv. Grouped together to form a new Autonomous Set.<br>
            v. Added to an existing Autonomous Set.

        </section>

            <h3>III. Role(s) of QAs on every “Autonomous Set”</h3>
            1. Lead’s (of Autonomous Set) qualifications and responsibilities:

            <div>
                &emsp;&emsp;a. Can either be a Mid- or Senior-Level QA.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;b. Has a solid knowledge of all the project(s) that belong to his/her Autonomous Set.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;c. Can closely keep track of the Sprint Schedule(s) for both (or all) the projects within
                his/her
                Autonomous Set.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;d. Can effectively manage time given the multiple project assignments.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;e. Can delegate task(s) to other QA members of his/her Autonomous Set.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;f. Do monitor the progress of every task card on both (or all) the projects within his/her
                Autonomous
                Set.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;g. Do send a comprehensive weekly report to the management about the current progress of the
                projects

            <p>The intended implementation of this proposal is during the <strong>Fourth Quarter of this year
                    (2022).</strong>Implementation will be <strong>divided into two (2) phases. </strong></p>
            <p class="p-indent">The first phase will have the first selected Autonomous Set, while the second phase will
                include all the Swappable projects grouped as Autonomous Sets. The reason behind this said two
                implementations is to ensure the readiness of all the QAs and other stakeholders to the nuts and bolts
                of the proposed new team structure implementation.</p>
            <p class="p-indent">There will be an Assessment period in between the First and Second Implementations.
                During this period, the implementation will be assessed and aim to identify the points for improvement,
                etc.</p>

            <p class="p-indent-L2">The organization’s development equates to responding and adapting to the industry’s
                changes and advances. This means that the Quality Assurance Division needs to provide a scalable
                solution in terms of the growing demands of the business. </p>

                implementation of this proposal is inevitable. Careful consideration of every situation and transparency
                all throughout the different phases are also key factors in achieving the desired results.</p>
            <p class="p-indent-L2">Being able to effectively manage said industry changes and advances implies that an
                organization can retain its overall efficiency.</p>
